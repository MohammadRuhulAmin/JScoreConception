What is Block ? 

==> 

{
    // this is block 
}

Block is also known as Compount statement .
It helps multiple javascript statement into one Group 


{
    var a = 10; // it will store inside window scope 
    let b = 10; // it will store inside block scope 
    const c = 10; // it will store inside block scope as well 
    we can use var variable in any where as it is 
    attached to window scope or object . 
    but we cannot use let / const out side of the scope .
