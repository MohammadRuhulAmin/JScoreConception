What is Garbage collection ? 

==> 
	Memory collection is done automatically.As long as any reference 
exist , there will not be any cleaning memory / garbage collection . In a referene 
of an object is missing  , that will be removed from memory automatically . 
Example : 1
let obj_1 = {name:"Someone"};
let obj_2 = obj_1;
obj_1 is assigned to obj_2 .
memory will be available for obj_1 & obj_2 . Both the objects will share the 
same memory location where the data is stored . 

if we assign null in obj_1 then one reference is gone .
obj_1 = null;
but there is still one reference pointing to obj_2 . That is why Garbage colletor will not
erase the data from memory . 

when we write this statement : 
obj_2 = null;
now there is no references for that memory data and it will removed from the memory . 
This is how the garbage collector manage memory . 
Example : 2 
let x = {name : "Someone"};
let a = [];
a.push(x);
the data can be accessed using both x & a[0] . both are refering the same location to 
access data . 
now the value of x can still be accessed by using a[0] element . 
So the garbage collector can remove the reference of x .
