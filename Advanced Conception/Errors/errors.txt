What is Syntax Error ? 

==> 
    Ex : 1 
    const a;
    if we dont assign the value of a  in that statement 
    it will show Syntax Error.
/------------------------------
    Ex : 2
    let a = 10;
    let a = 20;
    it will show syntax error 

What is Type Error ? 


==> 
    const a ;
    a = 10;
     /*
        console will show type Error . 
        if you declear const js engine expects you to 
        asign & declear at one statement . 
    */


What is Reference Error ? 

==> 

When javascript tries to find out the variable from 
Execution context memory component , but cannot access 
it somehow .

Ex : 1 
console.log(a)
let a = 100;

/*
    it will show reference error because of temporal dead zone . 
    for temporal dead zone,  causes  reference error .
*/

Ex : 2 
    {
        var a = 10;
        let b = 20;
        const c = 30;
        console.log(a)
        console.log(b)
        console.log(c)

    }

    console.log(a)   // Print the value 
    console.log(b)  // Reference Error 
    console.log(c) // Reference Error 



what is your priority for delearing variable ? 

==> 

const > let > var
