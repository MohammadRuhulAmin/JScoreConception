**Call stack is called the single  Thread in Javascript** 


Why javascript Runs everywhere  ? 

==> 
    javascript can be run inside machine , watch , robot , browser , everywhere 
    because of javascript run time environment.

    inside javascript run time environment there is javascript runtime engine .


What are the things that javascript runtime environment has ? 

==> 
    Javascript runtime environment  has : 
    1)Javascript Engine (the heart of javascript runtime environment)
    2) APIS (timer (setTimeout), console etc ... )
    3) Event Loop 
    4) Callback Queue 
    5) microtask Queue 
    
    Every browser has javascript runtime environment. 


Tell some different browsers javascript engine name . 


==> 
    mozila => spidermonkey engine (First javascript engine)
    MicrosoftEdge => chakra engine 
    GoogleChrome => V8 engine 
    Node js => V8 engine 
    DENO => V8 engine 

    google V8 engine is written using C++ . javascript engine is a program .


How javascript engine works executing javascript code ? 


==> 
    javascript engine takes the code as the input . 
    then it works into three steps : 
    
    1) Parsing  => 2) Compilation => Execution 



    1) Parsing : 
        => it converts a statement into token using syntax parser . 
        like : 
        let x = 12;
        [let] [x] [=] [12] all they are considered as token 
        Then syntax parser converts it to AST 
        

        AST = > Abstract Syntax Tree 
        
        [https://astexplorer.net] 

    2) Compilation : 
        AST comes to a Compile part . 

    3) Executation : 
        Executation Phase is contained with two major phase 
        a) Memory Heap (all the variables & functions are stored in memory) 
        b) Call Stack


What is Just intime compile Language ? and how does it works ? 


==> 

    It happens in compilation phase : 

    javascript code can be run in both compiler & interpreter.
    interpreter converts the javascript code into byte code  
    and the compiler at the same time optimize the byte code . 

    then they send it to the executation phase . 




What is Mark & Sweep algorithm ? 

==>
    using this algorithm javascript engine collect the gurbage & clear from memory heap . 
    the functions / variables  which are not executed for a long time are considered gurbage .


V8 engine compiler & interpreter name ? 

=>
    Compiler = turbo fan 
    Interpreter = ignition
