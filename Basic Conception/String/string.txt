What is interpolation in javascript ?

==> 
    when we use dynamic value inside template literals

What is the difference between == & === in javascript ? 

==>
    "==" -> checks only value 
    "===" -> check both value & type 
    
    let x = "Ruhul Amin";
    let y = new String("Ruhul Amin");
    if(x === y)console.log("They are same");
    else console.log("value & type is not matched !")
