What is javascript variables ? 

==> 


    It's a good programming practice to declare all variables at the beginning of a script.
    Variables are containers for storing values.
    Javascript syntax defines two type of variables 
        1.Fixed Values (Literals) 
            
            Ex : number can be written with or without decimals .
            Ex : String can be written as single coute or double coute .
            To implement the Literals : we use :=> 
            
                document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = "My name is Ruhul";
                document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = 122.12;
        
        2.Variable Values (Variables) 
            To define them we use let , var , const etc . 
        There are 4 ways to declare js variables 
         a)let b) var c) const d) nothing 

What is undefined ? 

==>
    A variable declared without a value will have the value undefined.
    Ex : 
    let myname; 
    // myname is assigned undefined by default .


When to Use JavaScript var?

==>

    Always declare JavaScript variables with var,let, orconst.
The var keyword is used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.
The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.
If you want your code to run in older browser, you must use var.

    We can redeclear var with same name as many time as we want . 
    Like : 
        var x = "Ruhul Amin";
        var x = 120;
        var x = 12.1;

What is let in javascript ? 

==>
    Variables defined with let cannot be Redeclared.
    Variables defined with let must be Declared before use.
    Variables defined with let have Block Scope.
    Variables defined with let cannot be redeclared.

    let x = "John Doe";
    let x = 0;
    // SyntaxError: 'x' has already been declared

    let , const is a block scoped variables 

    {
        let x = "something";
    }
    // x cannot be used here ! 

    Using a let variable before it is declared will result in a ReferenceError:
    console.log(myName);
    let myName = "Ruhul";

What is const ? 

==> 
    JavaScript const variables must be assigned a value when they are declared:
    correct statement  : 
        const myName = "Ruhul amin";
    
    incorrect statement : 
        const myName;
        myName = "Ruhul Amin";
    // Uncaught SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration



    It does not define a constant value. It defines a constant reference to a value.

Because of this you can NOT:

    Reassign a constant value
    Reassign a constant array
    Reassign a constant object

But you CAN:

Change the elements of constant array
    like : 
        const array = ["ruhul","sakib","sajid"];
        array[0] = "Aynun"; // okay 

        but you cannot reassign the array : 
    like : 
        const array = ['a','b','c'];
        array = ['d]; // not allowed ! 


Change the properties of constant object

    // You can create a const object:
    const car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"};

    // You can change a property:
    car.color = "red";

    // You can add a property:
    car.owner = "Johnson";


    but you cannot reassign the object .
    
    const car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"};
    car = {type:"Volvo", model:"EX60", color:"red"};    // ERROR


Why javascript types are dynamic ? 

==> 
    JavaScript Types are Dynamic
    JavaScript has dynamic types. This means that the same variable can be used to hold different data types.


When function invokes ? 
==>
     1.When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
     2.When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
     3.Automatically (self invoked)
