What is object prototype ? 

==> 
All JavaScript objects inherit properties and methods from a prototype.
The JavaScript prototype property allows you to add new properties to object constructors:

function Person(first, last, age, eyecolor) {
  this.firstName = first;
  this.lastName = last;
  this.age = age;
  this.eyeColor = eyecolor;
}

Person.prototype.nationality = "English";


The JavaScript prototype property also allows you to add new methods to objects constructors:

function Person(first, last, age, eyecolor) {
  this.firstName = first;
  this.lastName = last;
  this.age = age;
  this.eyeColor = eyecolor;
}

Person.prototype.name = function() {
  return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
};
