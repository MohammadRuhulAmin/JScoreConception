What is NaN ? 

==> 
    NaN is a JavaScript reserved word indicating that a number is not a legal number.

    example : 
    let x = 12;
    let y = "text";
    console.log(x/y); // will reply Not a Number 

    to check a value we can use javascript global function isNaN();
    console.log(isNun(x/y));
