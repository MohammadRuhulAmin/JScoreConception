Give some examples of Events in javascript .

==> 
    onchange	--> An HTML element has been changed
    onclick	    --> The user clicks an HTML element
    onmouseover	--> The user moves the mouse over an HTML element
    onmouseout	--> The user moves the mouse away from an HTML element
    onkeydown	--> The user pushes a keyboard key
    onload	    --> The browser has finished loading the page
    ========================================================================


When do we need Event handlers ? 

==> 
    Event handlers can be used to handle and verify user input, user actions, and browser actions
        1)Things that should be done every time a page loads
        Things that should be done when the page is closed
    Action that should be performed when a user clicks a button
    Content that should be verified when a user inputs data
    And more ...
    Many different methods can be used to let JavaScript work with events:

    HTML event attributes can execute JavaScript code directly
    HTML event attributes can call JavaScript functions
    You can assign your own event handler functions to HTML elements
    You can prevent events from being sent or being handled
    And more ...
