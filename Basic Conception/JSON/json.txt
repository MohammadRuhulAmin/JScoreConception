What is JSON?

==>
    JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
    JSON is a lightweight data interchange format
    JSON is language independent *
    JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand
    * The JSON syntax is derived from JavaScript object notation syntax, but the JSON format is text only. 
    Code for reading and generating JSON data can be written in any programming language.
    Ex : 
    {
    "employees":[
            {"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"},
            {"firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith"},
            {"firstName":"Peter", "lastName":"Jones"}
        ]
    }
    The JSON format is syntactically identical to the code for creating JavaScript objects.
    Because of this similarity, a JavaScript program can easily convert JSON data into native JavaScript objects.
