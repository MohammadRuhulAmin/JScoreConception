What is Execution Context ? 


Ans :

Everything in javascript happens inside execution context.
Execution Context is like a big box . It has two components in it. 
They Are : 
1) Memory Component (Variable Envieonment)
2) Code Component (Thread of Execution)


Memory Component : 
Memory Component is also known as variable environment.
In Memory Component all the variables and functions are stored in a key value pair .
(key:value) 

Code Component :
In this section the code is executed one line at a time . It is also known as Thread of Execution . 


Execution context is created in two phases . 

The Phases are  : 
1) First Phase  :  Cretion Phases / (Memory Creation Phase) 
2) Second Phase :  Code Execution Phase  

In First Phase The key value are assigned with undefined . The video on 4.23 are described .
In second Phase / the code execution phase ,  the key value are removed undefined with real value . 

When a function invoke from main , it creates another execution context . When function return a value , the 
execution context deleted automatically . 
If there are 100 function invoke , there are 100 excution context create. To handle these execution context
inside v8 engine , there is a conception calls call stack. 
Inside call stack the first element is the Global Execution Context.Then when the new function 
invokes , the Execution Context created and push back to the Call stack . when the works done , 
the Execution Context pop from the call stack . 

This is how the call stack manage all the Execution Contexts . 





** Javascript is a Synchronous Single Threated Language .
