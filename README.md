What is Execution Context ? 


Ans :

Everything in javascript happens inside execution context.
Execution Context is like a big box . It has two components in it. 
They Are : 
1) Memory Component (Variable Envieonment)
2) Code Component (Thread of Execution)


Memory Component : 
Memory Component is also known as variable environment.
In Memory Component all the variables and functions are stored in a key value pair .
(key:value) 

Code Component :
In this section the code is executed one line at a time . It is also known as Thread of Execution . 


Execution context is created in two phases . 

The Phases are : 
1) First Phase  :  Cretion Phases / (Memory Creation Phase) 
2) Second Phase :  Code Execution Phase  

In First Phase The key value are assigned with undefined . The video on 4.23 are described .
In second Phase / the code execution phase ,  the key value are removed undefined with real value . 





** Javascript is a Synchronous Single Threated Language .
