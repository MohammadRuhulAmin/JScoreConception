What is Window ? 
=> is a global object . When ever a javascript file is create , When it runs in browser the Global object 
Window is create and the Global Execution Context is Created . 

In Global level 

    this === window 

Means the type and the value is same . This object & Window object in type , value is same .

If we declare a variable or function in global space , it will attach to the window . 


like : 
window{
    a:12,
    b:function(){

    }
}

to access : the value or function 

console.log(window.a)
or 
console.log(this.a)
or 
console.log(a) 

The shortest file in js is not writing any code inside js file . 
Although not writing any code inside js file , it will create Global Execution Context & Window Object
